# 🧠 Parkinson's Disease Detection Using Machine Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to detect Parkinson's disease using a machine learning model trained on biomedical voice measurements. The goal is to assist in early diagnosis using accessible and efficient data-driven methods.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

- `main.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `data/`: Folder containing the dataset (if applicable).
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the [Shreya Dutta. (2024). Parkinson's Disease [Data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shreyadutta1116/parkinsons-disease). It contains 195 voice recordings from 31 individuals, with 23 people diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.

### Features:
- Biomedical voice measurements (e.g., MDVP:Fo(Hz), MDVP:Jitter(%), RPDE, DFA, etc.)
- `status` column indicating whether the subject has Parkinson’s (1) or not (0)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the dependencies with:
